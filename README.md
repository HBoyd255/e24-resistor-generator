# E24 Resistor Generator

This is a script that generated step files for 5-band E24 resistors.

The template resistor was created in [onshape.com](https://www.onshape.com/en/)
by me.

There are 169 resistors in the E24 series, from 1 Ohm to 10M Ohm, per tolerance,
so 1183 in total.

A collection of all the step files can be found at
